# Zoo-Tycoon

This is an application designed as a fun game you can spend your time on. 



## User Story

As a User, I would like to be able to play a game where I can manage a zoo.
As a Gamer, I’d like a click based game to waste my time with.
As a Gamer, I’d like to be able to adjust the settings of the game to my liking.

## Acceptance Criteria

It is done when we have a working interactive game with a polished UI, that a user can manage animals in.
It is done when we have a login function with JWT authentication, that a user can use to sign in and save their data of the game.
It is done when we have a settings page, where the user can adjust the setting of the game, including starting a new game/deleting their save file.
It is done when we have a leaderboard, to show the top earners in the game.
It is done when we are using React for the front end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, and MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

## Deployment

Link to the application: https://zoo-tycoon.onrender.com/

When entering the homepage, you are taken to the main page of the game, where you start with a balance of $50, a starting environmnet, and a starting animal pen. From there, you can purchase your first animal, which will start generating passive income. You can also click on a button linked to the environment to generate more income every time you click the button. The goal of the game is to gain more income, to buy better environments, pens, and animals until you reach the desired Blue Whale at the finish line!

In order to save your data, you must make an account using the sign in feature. You can then log in anytime you'd like to resume the game! There is also an option for some background music, while you are playing the game.
